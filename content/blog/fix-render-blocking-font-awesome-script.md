### More Font Awesome Rendering Optimization

Font Awesome's script render-blocking slows down your website's loading speed by a significant amount according to [Gmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). Here are other methods to fix the render blocking more after the above hack. This can also work for WordPress websites:

1.  **Use Font Awesome Kit:** Font Awesome loads the icons asynchronously.
2.  **Move Script to Bottom:** The Font Awesome script tag should be moved from the `<head>` section to the bottom closing `</body>` tag. Pages
3.  **Defer Attribute:** Adding the `defer` attribute to the script tag can further improve performance.
4.  **Async Attribute (Use with Caution):** The `async` attribute is another option. Unlike `defer`, `async` allows the script to load HTML parsing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
5.  **Use Only Include Used Icons**

Now, save the template and proceed to the speed testing tool to determine whether the speed of your website has increased. This progress is excellent for optimizing your blogger blog and achieving a 100% optimized website. Continue optimizing the other resources such as images and other CSS and Javascript codes that might be responsible for the slowing down of your website which jeopardizes the SEO state of your website.
