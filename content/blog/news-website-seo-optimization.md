Today I got some people asking how I automate my blogger news website traffic just in a month. The secret was so simple, people like complicating SEO. I paid an SEO company in Semdeals and they even gave me their subdomain to work on News. News website SEO is done in some stages that include backlinking, getting backlinks, internal linking, Title SEO, homepage SEO, and Content SEO. News websites should have some particular things that they should never lack for SEO. Let me give you the exact details of how I got the news website SEO services done by Semdeals. Professional

#### Title SEO Optimization.

The first thing I experienced when I gave out my workspace in SEO Clive was that they changed my homepage title which was one word too many words that made sense and related to the categories I write my News for. I never knew before that you can rank better by optimizing the title tags of your homepage. The title changed from News Clive to News Clive Entertainment and World News Resource.

#### Meta description SEO optimization.

The meta description of my news website did not match that was related to what I offer, but instead, it was all I knew people would love to see. The SEO done included adding the categories win homepage meta description with well-placed words. The search engines know what my news website was all about. This was awesome, I was so down in ranking but all of a sudden I automated at least 100,000 views in my first month. Thanks to SEO clive services. I also noticed that the number of words in my meta description was fixed so well to fit the three lines in the search results, my meta description was of one line which was separated in search results.

#### Internal linking SEO Services.

I never knew how internal linking was paramount until I saw that in my Google search console panel. Google had a full internal linking panel to see how you have linked your post together to increase the click-through rate. Truly SEO this year has changed a lot and I learned how to SEO optimize my blog post through internal linking. Now I link my post with related post topics to make sure that they improve my click-through rate. I hope you learned from the internal linking Tutorial and wrote a post that includes some.

#### Getting Backlinks For SEO

I had before heard of backlinks but I never knew the actual importance. I saw that my top competitor had at least 400,000 backlinks which shocked me. That's when I knew SEO is not easy, to work for it to prove the search engines that you are worth the lot. This was easy since Semeals got me at least 2000 backlinks. I saw a significant change in SEO when I saw my Alexa rank move from 12 million to 6 million. Is this so easy like so? Get backlinks today by commenting on other websites and talking to the authors and also take part in guest writing on related famous websites that can bring you traffic to your news website.

#### News Content SEO.

How I did wrong by writing News the way I thought writing and it was so wrong. I never had well-written topics on my news website. I used heavy images in my posts that jeopardized the speed of my webpage. It wasn't until I tried SEO services from SEO Deals that they changed nearly all my blog. News post topics with relevant keywords that were needed. The topic titles were straight to the point and I learned a new way to write my post by optimizing everything.

I hope You enjoyed the tutorial and now I want to leave you with the saying that, no pain no gain. I think it's time you get help from an SEO company. Start making money with organic traffic automation on your news website.
