## 1. Digital Marketing – Social media

Digital marketing is generally showcasing products on social media platforms to generate customers and more users and clicks. Take into consideration some of the greatest betting websites around and you will see how they can generate income through the internet and advertisements all over the places around. The same technique can be used by any other Blogger out there who makes income through ads.

This type of digital media card includes Twitter and Facebook cards. The changing look of your website link in the post by arranging the post share with a post thumbnail and a small snippet.

### 2. Content Marketing

Content marketing is different from digital marketing in the way that you only market what is inside the website to generate more sales or event clicks. By so doing, some of the biggest web brands around have popular brand ambassadors to appear in posts. To market your content, you need interesting deals, products, and productive posts. The below points are the most needed content [SEO](/category/seo/) marketing skills.

1.  Quality Product
2.  Quality Posts
3.  [Marketing Plan](https://joecalih.co.ke/category/marketing/)
4.  Product deals
5.  Good User interface

Even with quality products and good posts, without a marketing plan and a great user interface, it will be the hardest thing ever to automate good sales and clicks on your website. I like the beautiful website with a simple and legitimate-looking interface. What distinguishes pro websites from fake websites, is the interface that the website has for users. Product deals include things like the Black Friday deals where people can get discounts on goods at a particular given time. All the above points play a major role in traffic generation and automation.

### 3. Affiliate marketing

You can get people coming to your website through affiliate SEO marketing. In the outside world, we have people who have an enormous number of followers. Marketing agencies can generate a large number of website users by publishing your ads on their social media and mass sharing. These services are done for a price with a measure of how many people have been brought to your website by the advertisers.

### 4. Growth hacking

Growth hacking includes generating traffic with extra marketing skills that exceed other website marketing plans. Some of these growth hacking techniques include giving away free stuff from related post topics. Take for instance apple company wants to generate more product visitors. This includes a free iPhone x to people who will comment on any product on Apple’s website to enter the draw. This is a 100% traffic generation method for your website, believe it or not.

Growth in search results has changed, especially after the introduction of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies on big data. Companies are now integrating new technologies to avoid being left behind. Websites such as Chat GPT impact SEO at a very large scale forcing Google and Bing to prefer AI results on search engines. Many websites will lose a significant amount of traffic due to these new tech advances. Use our website to bootstrap your search results with AI today!

### 5. Google AdWords

[Google AdWords](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) always helps to rank in search results even more than the one competing company with the best post concerning the same topic. Whenever you use AdWords well, you will always appear in the top number one even with fewer posts. Take the example of Hosting in the USA. When you search for hosting in the USA, the top hosting companies in the USA will not appear first. Instead, you will see Go Daddy hosting company based in the UK as number one in search results.  
Google AdWords is a paid-for service, but it’s very efficient and good for any topic you want to rank in. When both SEO and good content writing get combined in a post and later Google AdWords. It is used, you will always rank number one in that topic in Google
