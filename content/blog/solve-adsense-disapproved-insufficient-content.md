### 6. Google Page Speed Checker

When website designers finish coding the website template, their primary focus is the website’s speed during the loading process. To determine the loading time, one useful tool is the Google speed checker. It assesses all the code resources of a website and provides accurate statistics for both PC and mobile views. Responsive websites should prioritize good loading speed insights.

The JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML code utilized in a website occupy server space. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize these codes and host them on fast-loading servers. This ensures that website users can access the website quickly and efficiently. Thanks to Google, it is now possible to monitor the resources responsible for slowing down the website’s loading time. This enables the modification of modules to enhance loading speeds.
