The difference between **[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)** vs **[Blogger](http://blogger.com/)** in blogging is the requirements for your expected blog design and expectations. You may happen to archive more in WordPress than in Blogger but that doesn’t make blogger less productive. The big question is, Which Is The Best **Blogging Platform?** I have used [Blogger](https://joecalih.co.ke/build-high-quality-backlinks-in-blogger/) for 10 years with experience in both WordPress and Blogger web design and that gives me a reason to choose the best platform for bloggers use. Let’s get Dipper to choose between Blogger vs WordPress and see which one is the best for blogging.

The functionality features of the desired platform are a major consideration. Choosing between both of these platforms is based on the cost of website building, [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), and user interface. Blogging is different from woo-commerce and organization websites. Lets get down the specific features that will make you choose which platform to use in your blogging life.

### Features of WordPress Blogging Platform

WordPress is renowned for building dynamic website designs that easily integrate functionalities through plugin installations and the use of multiple website templates. The below-listed points include reasons to choose the WordPress blogging platform for its features.

#### **1. Plenty of Template Themes**

WordPress has a wide range of customized templates to choose from all over the internet. Its templates can be found on famous template selling websites such as the [Theme-forest](http://themeforest.net/) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). You have a wide

range of templates builders that can help you design for yourself your design plan. Integration of buying and selling of products is even made easy in WordPress, something that will not happen in blogger.com future. Choosing a template in WordPress is easy but the downside of it is that , most WordPress themes are **EXPENSIVE**.

#### **2. User-Friendly Admin Panel**

I always envy how the admin panel in WordPress looks like all the time and I wish I had such a beautiful panel in blogger.com. Everything in the website is run from the admin panel. It is simple to integrate plugins and APIs from different platforms to work on the server admin panel. WordPress gets better as the plugins get updated and more functionalities are added. This gets better after adding SEO plugins such as [Yoast Seo](https://yoast.com/) which predicts the search engine capabilities of ranking when witting your post before publishing. I wish blogger.com would add more functions to its admin panel and people would appreciate more.

#### **3. Hosting WordPress on Any Compatible Server**

A server is a data-holding computer that stores your website data and folders. Blogger.com has only one compatible server since all its websites are hosted on Google web servers. In WordPress, you can host your website on any web server if it’s compatible with the WordPress application. Hosting is EXPENSIVE. Approximately 90% of all the hosting companies in the world host websites annually at a fee of 50$ without considering a web domain. For a small blogging website that is generally a lot of money billed yearly. In [Godady.com](https://uk.godaddy.com/) you can have your first year in WordPress for only 12$ and that’s cheap.

#### **4. You Can Use the Root Domain.**

The root domain is always short ad SEO friendly. All professional websites tend to use root domains instead of sub-domains to link their websites. This feature is absent in the blogger platform which makes it not advisable to use blogger.com in woo-commerce websites. That’s a big downside of bloggers and that’s why we give a big check-mark to WordPress. ( eg. seoblur.com instead of www.seoblur.com)

#### **5. Choose Of Link Formats**

linking formats are different, there is the one with date numbers in between and the one without any number linking direct to the words without a HTML ending word. In Blogger you only get to choose the link words but the date numbers are added automatically to your website without extra permissions making the URL nonuser friendly and not the best for SEO. Date numbers in URL are only best in news websites and not for tutorials and serious contents.

**NOTE.**  
WordPress has thousands of customizable functionalities that this post cannot highlight. The main reasons why people choose the WordPress functionalities is because of the diversity and clean user-friendly professional Admin panel.

### Features Of Blogger.com Platform

Blogger by Google has many goodies from free staff to use and simple. However, it missed some of the latest fixes and good plugins that WordPress has to offer. Below are the main features included in Blogger.

#### 1. FREE Hosting

This is the number one reason why millions of people use blogger.com. Consider a beginner blogger wants to start over having his first website, it would be best advisable to use blogger.com without spending on WordPress platform which is simple and EXPENSIVE to start. The same reason is why I use blogger.com up to date. Basically, all you need is a Google email address from Gmail. The Google web servers hosting blogger websites are fast enough to make sure your websites will never have downtime. Any traffic coming to your website is not measured to limit your hosting plan which is always free and that gives me joy which every blogger using the blogger.com platform has.

#### 2. FREE Domain

If you are looking forward to have a **FREE domain** to start blogging with without buying your own custom domain then blogger.com is the perfect blogging platform to be. Your website will have a .blogger name extension. Lets say your website name is true host, then your free domain name will be truehost.blogspot.com which will redirect every traffic to their country short name extension. It’s a good feature for beginner bloggers but I would recommend buying a custom domain after having your blogger-free domain and hosting.

#### 3. FREE Email Marketing

Many beginners on blogger.com don’t really know about the FREE email subscribe marketing lifetime plan provided free by Google in the feed burner RSS feeds. That`s the email marketing strategy company I have used for the past 10 years and it’s actually the best-ever marketing plan. Most WordPress email subscriptions have a fee. Such email marketing companies include, mail chimp which is the world’s number one best email marketing plan, and RSS. To make use of this free blogger feature head on to [Feedburner.com](http://feedburner.com/) and register your website RSS feeds to be burnt for email marketing.

#### 4. Fast Indexing.

Indexing is the search engine appearance of your website links in search engines. You can expect this because the biggest search engine company, holding the number one position in the Alexa rank, hosts you. Once you create a website in Blogger, you get indexed within minutes, unlike Blogger where you have to go to webmaster tools to submit your website for indexing. This shows that still, search engines can consider a blogger website to have small features.

**NOTE.**  
Blogger.com offers a range of free features, but it may be less productive since it lacks dedicated programming investments to make it the best. However, if you possess a good understanding of search engines and are a blogger aiming to generate revenue from ad placements, then using Blogger could be worth considering.  
Before we choose which is which, let’s see the different reasons for my final choice as to which one of the two platforms is the best for blogging.

### Reasons Blogger Is The Best Blogging Platform

Besides making quality content and becoming a public figure, being a blogger is all about making money out of your website. A website based on making money without ads is not a blogging website. Such websites include:-  
a. Woo commerce  
b. Affiliate Marketing Websites.  
c. Brand Websites.

The above types of websites are not categorized in blogging and that’s why is best to use WordPress in those websites, but as a blogger, the main reason you make a website is to place ads and make money.  
**Blogger.com** platform gives you all features for **FREE**. Any revenue you get from blogging is not brought back to buy the expensive hosting plan as it is in WordPress. Almost all free blogger.com features and functionalities are expensive in WordPress. The bottom line as to why **Blogger.com** is the best blogging platform  is that you will make more money and rank if you are good in blogging.  
Before I started blogging on blogger.com, I had come across different websites talking about how

WordPress is the best platform compared to all the others in blogging. With 10 years of experience in blogging, I can now tell that there is no major difference between blogger.com and WordPress platforms. In fact, blogger cuts down my cost of blogging making it possible for me to generate more revenue. It’s as simple as having a Gmail account and heading over to blogger.com
