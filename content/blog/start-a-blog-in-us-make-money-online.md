Americans have the great opportunity to make a living online by blogging. Considering the easy steps you need to start when making a blog, starting a blog is made easy for you. You can make up to $100 as a beginner through ad services and affiliates in your blog. In the U.S., numerous resources show how to start a blog, providing online hosting and domain services. Before we start talking about blogging services, let us venture into what to consider as a beginner regarding how to start a blog in the U.S. and be able to make money.

### 1. How To Choose What To Blog About

Choosing what you want to blog about will be derived from what information you have or can get that you can offer to others. After knowing what you would like to write about, you have to find the categories or labels that you will use. What you want to blog about may not have a good amount of traffic density, thus it's always important to research well on the amount of traffic that a category receives to have people viewing your blog to make money.

The category you choose should be of the blogging information you can provide, and for that reason, it's paramount that you research well on your competitors and know what kind of topics and categories they have so you can borrow some ideas from them before you start your blog, so you can do better and generate many ways to make money online.

### 2. Blogging Platforms To Choose From In The U.S.

The main platforms you can use in blogging are:

-   **Blogger** - Google Blogging Platform - FREE HOSTING
-   **WordPress.org** - Self-Hosted - Paid HOSTING
-   **WordPress.com** - FREE HOSTING

The above are the main blogging platforms that successful bloggers use. For better revenue making of a blog, it's best to use the self-hosted WordPress since it's the best blogging platform that you can use to get ranked better. WordPress is the best, but the others also are good platforms for blogging. How to start a blog on WordPress is less complex than the other platforms and has the best plugins. They offer tools to help you organize your blog and build it from scratch for beginners. Blogger, on the other hand, is a good product from Google. A free and good resource for those who don't want to incur prices in hosting services. You get free hosting and a domain name for free on Blogger, but I would prefer that you buy a domain name to add it as a custom redirect in Blogger.

### 3. How To Research And Choose A Host Service In The U.S.

Hosting services are given by many companies, but I would prefer that you don't rely solely on local servers. Many other hosting services from all over the world have high speeds to ensure that your website will never be unavailable or slow. Choose the hosting services with the best speed in their services. Popular hosting companies such as Bluehost, GoDaddy, and HostGator offer the cheapest, most affordable, and highest-quality hosting services globally.

It's good to choose the hosting plan that suits you best. There are diverse hosting plans depending on the website that you are going to set up. If you have various websites that you want to upload to one server, then the dedicated server hosting plan is the best to suit your plans. Some hosting services come with freebies that are of paramount importance. SSL encryption is one of the best freebies that you can get from a good hosting plan at a cheap price from the above hosting companies.

### 4. How To Pick Out A Domain Name

Choosing a domain name should always be based on what you want to blog about. If the blog is personal, a name will be better to use than using a company name. If your blog is for learning purposes, then make the domain authority from the best keywords of your blog posts' topic categories. Take a good example from my blog:

**Semdeals** - Semdeals offers SEO, SEO Guide, Blogging Tips, Blog Design, Create A Blog, Blogging, Blogger Widgets, Content Marketing, and Blogger Tutorials. by Joecalih

The best name for my domain from my meta description was picked from what I will be blogging about, and that's SEO. So when I went to GoDaddy to buy my domain, I chose the best domain name. Semdeals.com, since it came from the category I blog about.

### 5. How To Design Your Blog As A Beginner

Web Blog Design is all about what niche you venture into, and the design should resemble your type of content. The colors of a website tell a lot about a website. It's good to design your website with a good user interface to encourage users to come back for more. A portfolio website for a fashion designer should always have the look of their design. The most used colors that mark the fashion brand. Logos, and the design of the post body and homepage of the website, would have the brand color you want to focus on and the font to use all over the blog. When starting a new blog, it's good to consider readable content designs and fonts to avoid an increased bounce rate on your website.
