Set the apple-mobile-web-app-capable mobile browser meta tag to yes to turn on standalone mode. For example, the following HTML code displays web content using standalone mode.

> <meta name=”apple-mobile-web-app-capable” content=”yes”>

You can change the appearance of the default safari status bar to either black or black-translucent. With the black translucent, the status bar floats on top of the full-screen content, rather than pushing it down. This gives the layout more height value but obstructs the top. You require the following code:

> <meta name=”apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style” content=”black”>

Let me show you what it will look like when implemented.
