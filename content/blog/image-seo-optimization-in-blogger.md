Image SEO looks at every aspect of its requirements to rank your content. As a result of the requirements, a blogger must make his/her content in the correct way that robots would like for them to rank. Image optimization is one of the paramount factors that can get your content ranked. If you include some steps that are so paramount in the [SEO life cycle](/simplest-seo-practices-for-blogger-websites/) of content writing.

**How Can You Optimize Images For Better SEO?**

Before we study the steps or even make you lack the big part of this article. I would like to empower you with this one great piece of information the search engines. Never look at the physical picture. As a result, it only calculates the number of people who like the picture to rank you. I know now you are asking yourself how does that happen. It’s simple when you include the following steps.

### 1. Change the Image Title to Post a Keyword

This is a paramount step and this helps so that Google would read the name and give image results according to the name. It’s paramount that you include the name that is relevant and related to your content and most of the time include the keywords so that it can get SEO benefits too.

Many times when I search for images I go to the image SEO search section to choose the best image. Think of how you will lose SEO optimization for not formatting your blogger blog images in the right manner. Before you post a picture, don’t forget to change the name. Start with the best keywords that people search for by using long tail keywords.

### 2. Add ALT Keys To Images

I prefer using alt keys in photos since it gives the search engines a clue that the photo is related to the post. Search engines only use the two options and you can get the feature in Blogger by clicking on properties after uploading the image. Website images get indexed and ranked better with search results optimization. Alt tags are represented in the image to receive downloads and traffic from popular search engines.

Images drive up to 30% of many website traffic results derived from search engine indexing and image viewing. This generates large traffic to your website for image downloads or more information.
