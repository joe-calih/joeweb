To know what search engines would appreciate in a website is a task. I remember my first time doing SEO practices on my website it took me at least 2 months. Remove a bunch of errors from the webmaster Google console. You can play around with code to impress the bots in SEO engines. Now I can professionally guide you with the best practices to work out your blog to get the best ranking results for your website in 2025.  
Maybe it’s not the first time you see a content SEO guide on the net but this one piece is extremely different. Let me explain to you why. First of all, people think content SEO practices are only done by optimizing your website content more and making it better than others. The main thing is that not it.

### 1. AMP best SEO Website Practices

The AMP ( Accelerated Mobile Pages ) will automatically rank you number one in Google Bing and Yahoo. I’ll assist you on how this goes. Well, I have a Blogger website that had so much code in it, and in the webmaster tools, I had an alert that I should increase text than code. I learned about accelerated mobile pages and learned that last year that topic was discussed thoroughly by Google developers and it’s one requirement that will be a must to apply to rank shortly. What’s the Info on the AMP? What it does is that it increases the loading speed in phones by avoiding some complex Java codes that lag your website behind after clicking on your page article. The image illustrates.

Take a look at the picture and you will notice the news snippets which is a good SEO sign have a thunder symbol that is written AMP. The photo is from Wikipedia and that’s what makes Wikipedia rank a lot in most search results. When I knew about this exercise that can get me ranked in Google I had to wait no longer.

#### How To Use AMP To Improve SEO

I will also write a complete article on this but let me take you to simpler steps. AMP can be used by using an AMP project to add code to your template. Whenever you post an article it can be optimized for mobile use. In WordPress [AMP](https://seohuk.com/how-to-add-google-amp-to-blogger-website/) is made even simpler to employ in templates with the help of plugins. You can enable the feature in your template easily. Use the AMP project and better your website this year for good SEO results. AMP pages and those that don’t use amp look way different in Google search engines. Let’s say I have a page of a product that am selling and at the same time use a website with an amp and a website without. The bellow will be the search results.

Assume you are a search engine bot, which you are not. You have these two great pieces of content talking about this awesome-looking jacket. You have to go through the code so you can load the page with the product. One has fewer codes that load so fast and you can easily go through. The other one has complex Java code that takes time to load and is disturbing. Which one would you go for?  
The same way Google processes and ranks content with AMP SEO this year 2019. Use AMP today and thank me later since you will witness a good sign in the ranking of your content. I hope I have empowered someone today. 2019 SEO is now at your fingertips, I used the idea and Google is waiting for you to use it too so they can take your higher. Gods plan.

### 2. Structured Data SEO Practice 2023

This is something you have come across since you started your first blog. Since the time immemorial of your blogging history. This SEO practice is something we should not even talk about this Year 2018 since you should have implemented it a long time ago. Look at all the successful people with websites. People flock daily and look at the search engines’ structure and you will be amazed. They have used all the structured data available that match their content and give out better descriptions and specify logos and meta content.

**Are you a Beginner**?  
If you search out Apple in your search engine ( Google ) this will be the result you will receive in your browser. Take a look from the title to the end you can see the structure of the content so well. By the side, it’s evident that their logo is there so you can know the brand well. The information goes even further to show our ranks and contacts and also social links that you can use to follow up on their product and stories. [Google](https://seohuk.com/how-to-load-google-web-fonts-faster-in-blogger/) SEO loves this so much.

> I and you also love this. Its so bad to see a plain website domain name with a small description of the website without enough info. If you don’t have a clue about this i better take you to an SEO tour to webmaster tools so you can see various snippets and structured data that are used by the best ranked websites.
