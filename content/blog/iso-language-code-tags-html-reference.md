It’s vital to declare the language you use in your website blog posts and that is declared by several ISO language code tags written in HTML that know the language you use in writing posts so that your traffic can be from the right source of related language people. To declare the language in HTML we use a two-letter language code or three letters. Some websites go to the extent of using an XML language tag.

Website crawlers from search engines use language tags to determine the language used in the writing of the posts. If you have used the language tags declaring English language from the USA then the English used in the post should not have a British English version and thus any British English words are considered spelling mistakes.

### How To Use Href Language Tags In A Website

A website uses the abbreviation of the language tags from the full name of the language and the origin. In the meta HTML tags of the href language declaration, the language used is written as attached below.

> <html lang=”en”>  
> </html>

Then when using XML to refer to the declaration of the language tag than it’s assigned as below.

> <html xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” lang=”en” xml:lang=”en”>  
> </html>

The Short Codes are derived from language and that’s what we declare as ISO value and the country language. When your website has errors in language declaration, the iso language value is not declared for the page showing errors. To know whether your website has language errors, the Google search console will inform you that you have not specified your language in the code. The country language code ISO is derived as follows.
