Structured data is the definition of content in search engines to bring up a situation. In news articles, schema markup is used widely to show the news in the carousel view. News article schema markup is a necessity for any News blogger blog. Blogger environment blogs are hard to implement schema but widely encourage the use of schema markup. The main aim of a News Schema News Article is to understand news excerpts from post content.

## How To Add News Article Schema Markup To Blogger

I had earlier mentioned that Google always acknowledges the js+load version of rich results from the schema and vocabulary because they are Google-based. In this case, we are going to use the ld+json of news article schema markup data in our blogger blog which I am going to instruct you nicely and easily.

First, before we integrate the rich schema, I have to ask if you use the amp version of posts in your blogger blog. Mostly AMP is not part of Google's plan to be used in bloggers since labels will always show errors but if you have AMP in your blogger blog then well and good because the news article schema markup of the ld+json will very well both work for AMP and Non-AMP websites.

JSON-LD: widely used on AMP and Non-AMP Blogs.  
MICRODATA: Only Amp versions of AMP pages are supported

In that case, that's why I chose the Json-ld news article schema markup over the microdata one when sharing with you. Without wasting so much time, I think now your blogger blog is fit to have the schema markup. Let's jump into the tutorial.

### JSLOD-LD News Article For Blogger

Google recommends the use of the following version, so use this one instead of the one below. It will change your blogger's blog-rich results.

\`\`\`
<script type="application/ld+json"> {   "@context": "http://schema.org",   "@type": "NewsArticle",   "mainEntityOfPage": {     "@type": "WebPage",     "@id": "https://google.com/article"   },   "headline": "Article headline",   "image": {     "@type": "ImageObject",     "url": "https://google.com/thumbnail1.jpg",     "height": 800,     "width": 800   },   "datePublished": "2017-02-05T08:00:00+08:00",   "dateModified": "2017-02-05T09:20:00+08:00",   "author": {     "@type": "Person",     "name": "John Doe"   },    "publisher": {     "@type": "Organization",     "name": "Google",     "logo": {       "@type": "ImageObject",       "url": "https://google.com/logo.jpg",       "width": 600,       "height": 60     }   },   "description": "A most wonderful article" } </script>
