-   Your title tag should also be limited to the use of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and commas

### **2. Proper Meta Keywords**

-   Should contain information about the page’s content and persuade the search engine users to visit your website. The best meta description should contain what is in the post content to enhance the SEO of the meta description to avoid going off-topic.
-   Between 25 and 35 words in length. This means that every sentence should not be longer than two lines on your post page.

### **3. Use H1 Heading**

-   Should contain between 5-10 keywords or keyword phrases that are also found in the page content.
-   Should use at least one H1 heading tag for the search engines that examine it when scanning your site.
-   Pages must have 300 words.

### **4. Have Blogger Sitemaps**

-   Each page of your site should contain links to every other page so search engine spiders can find every page. This is a critical step for the proper indexing and Page-rank distribution of your site.

### **5. Use robots.txt In Blogger**

-   It’s important to use two site maps for your website–an XML version and a static version. XML version created using search engine visibility’s sitemap tool. The static version should sit on a static HTML page and contain links to every other page.

### **6. Create Unique Content**

-   Because search engines treat websites as a grouping of pages and not a single entity, each page on your site should be unique so that the tags and content differ between each page. Doing so increases the number of pages that will rank.

### **7. Use Proper Image Tag (Alt)**

-   Each page should include a relevant image with a proper image tag. This makes your page more visually appealing and enables search engines to catalog the image.
-   Image cannot be displayed (wrong src, slow connection, etc), Alt attribute provides alternative information. Using keywords and human-readable captions in the alt attributes is a good SEO practice because search engines cannot see the images. For images with a decorative role (bullets, round corners, etc) you are advised to use an empty alt or a CSS background image.

### **8. Limit HTTP Requests**

-   Your page must have no more than 20 HTTP requests. You can try reducing HTTP requests through various methods such as using text instead of images, using CSS sprites, using data URLs instead of images, or combining several external files into one.
-   The recommended page size is under 33 KB. This leads to a faster page loading time than average.

-   Check your URL and in-page URLs for underscore characters. The general advice is to use hyphens or dashes (-) rather than underscores (_). Google treats hyphens as separators between words in a URL – unlike underscores.
-   Check if your page is connected to at least one of the most important social networks. Social signals are getting increasing importance as ranking factors for search engines because it leverages social intelligence (via our interactions) to determine more accurate relevancy for searches. That’s why connecting your website to a social network is a must nowadays to make sure your site is socially enabled.
