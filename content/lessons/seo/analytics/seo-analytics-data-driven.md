    # Chi-square test
    observed = [[control_clicks, control_impressions - control_clicks],
                [test_clicks, test_impressions - test_clicks]]
    
    chi2, p_value = stats.chi2_contingency(observed)[:2]
    
    return {
        'p_value': p_value,
        'significant': p_value < 0.05,

        final_weight = time_weight * position_weight * channel_weights.get(touchpoint['channel'], 1.0)
        weights[touchpoint['channel']] = weights.get(touchpoint['channel'], 0) + final_weight
    
    # Normalize weights
