## How Search Engines Work

Search engines follow a three-step process:

### 1. Crawling
Search engine bots (spiders) discover and scan web pages by following links.

### 2. Indexing
The discovered content is analyzed and stored in the search engine's database.

### 3. Ranking
When users search, the engine retrieves and ranks relevant pages based on hundreds of factors.

## The SEO Foundation: Keyword Research

Keywords are the foundation of SEO. Here's how to approach keyword research:

### Types of Keywords

| Keyword Type | Example | Search Volume | Competition |
|--------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Short-tail | "SEO" | High | Very High |
| Long-tail | "how to do SEO for small business" | Lower | Lower |
| Local | "SEO services near me" | Medium | Medium |
| Commercial | "best SEO tools" | Medium | High |

### Keyword Research Process

1. **Brainstorm seed keywords**
   - Think about your business/topic
   - Consider what your audience searches for

2. **Use keyword research tools**
   - Google Keyword Planner
   - SEMrush
   - Ahrefs
   - Ubersuggest

3. **Analyze search intent**
   - Informational: "what is SEO"
   - Navigational: "Google Analytics login"
   - Commercial: "best SEO tools"
   - Transactional: "buy SEO course"

## On-Page SEO Fundamentals

On-page SEO involves optimizing individual web pages. Here are the key elements:

### Title Tags
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Make it compelling and clickable

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<title>SEO Basics: Complete Guide for Beginners (2024)</title>
\`\`\`

### Meta Descriptions
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Write compelling copy that encourages clicks

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<meta name="description" content="Learn SEO basics with our complete beginner's guide. Master keyword research, on-page optimization, and technical SEO to rank higher on Google.">
\`\`\`

### Header Structure
Use headers to create a logical content hierarchy:

\`\`\`html
<h1>Main Topic (Primary Keyword)</h1>
  <h2>Major Section</h2>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
    <h3>Another Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Another Major Section</h2>
\`\`\`

### Internal Linking Strategy

Internal links help search engines understand your site structure and distribute page authority. Here's how to implement effective internal linking:

#### Internal Linking Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive anchor text**
   - ❌ "Click here"
   - ✅ "Learn about keyword research techniques"

2. **Link to relevant pages**
   - Connect related content
   - Help users find more information

3. **Create topic clusters**
   - Main pillar page about broad topic
   - Cluster pages about specific subtopics
   - All cluster pages link back to pillar

#### Internal Linking Structure Example

\`\`\`
SEO Guide (Pillar Page)
├── Keyword Research (Cluster)
├── On-Page SEO (Cluster)
├── Technical SEO (Cluster)
└── Link Building (Cluster)
\`\`\`

### Content Optimization

#### Content Length and Depth
Research shows longer content tends to rank better:

| Word Count | Average Ranking Position |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 0-500 words | Position 7.8 |
| 500-1000 words | Position 6.2 |
| 1000-2000 words | Position 4.1 |
| 2000+ words | Position 2.3 |

#### Content Structure for SEO
1. **Introduction** (100-150 words)
   - Hook the reader
   - Include primary keyword
   - Preview what's covered

2. **Body sections** with clear headers
   - Use H2s for main sections
   - Include secondary keywords
   - Add examples and data

3. **Conclusion** (50-100 words)
   - Summarize key points
   - Include call-to-action

## Technical SEO Basics

Technical SEO ensures search engines can crawl and index your site effectively.

### Site Speed Optimization
Page speed is a ranking factor. Target these metrics:

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | ≤2.5s | 2.5s-4.0s | >4.0s |
| First Input Delay (FID) | ≤100ms | 100ms-300ms | >300ms |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | ≤0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | >0.25 |

### Mobile Optimization
With mobile-first indexing, ensure your site is mobile-friendly:
- Responsive design
- Fast loading on mobile
- Easy navigation
- Readable text without zooming

### URL Structure
Create SEO-friendly URLs:
- ✅ `example.com/seo-basics-guide`
- ❌ `example.com/page?id=123&cat=seo`

Track these key metrics to measure your SEO performance:

### Organic Traffic Metrics
| Metric | What it Measures | Tools |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Organic Sessions | Visitors from search engines | Google Analytics |
